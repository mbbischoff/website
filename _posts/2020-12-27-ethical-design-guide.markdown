> Tech is always political. The way data is collected and handled is often biased, and many products are neither accessible nor inclusive. Ethical Design Guide is made to share resources on how to create ethical products that don't cause harm.

[Sarah L. Fossheim](https://twitter.com/liatrisbian?s=21) just [released](https://twitter.com/liatrisbian/status/1342961111671386113) this wonderful collection of resources (and monthly newsletter) on how to make digital products more inclusive. It covers topics from accessibility, to race, to gender. I’ll be bookmarking this and referring to it often. Huge thanks to them for putting it together. (Via [Jillian](http://jillianmeehan.com).)
