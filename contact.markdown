# Contact

I’m an extrovert, and I love hearing from old friends and meeting new ones. I really enjoy having conversations with people new to the technology industry, LGBTQ+ folks, and anyone that want to work together or collaborate on creative projects. While I try to get back to everyone who reaches out, it may take me a few days if things are particularly busy.

Need a conversation starter? Here’s [what I’m up to now](https://matthewbischoff.com/now/).

Here are the best ways to get in touch:

🐦  DM me on Twitter at [@mb](https://twitter.com/mb).  
📧  Email me at [mb@matthewbischoff.com](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com).  
📲  Send me a text at <a href="tel:+16097060597">+1 (609) 706-0597</a>.  
🗓  Schedule a [30 minute call](https://calendly.com/matthewbischoff/30-minute-call).  

## Encrypted Options 🔐

If you’d like to communicate me in an encrypted manner, you can reach me on Telegram at [matthewbischoff](http://t.me/matthewbischoff) or chat with me via Keybase at [matthewbischoff](https://keybase.io/matthewbischoff).
