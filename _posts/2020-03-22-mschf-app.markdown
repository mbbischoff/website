The [delightful weirdos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/style/millennial-entrepreneur-startups.html) over at performance art/tech company [MSCHF](https://mschf.xyz) just launched a new app. The app does what they used to do via text messages until the phone companies starting blocking their numbers: allows you to chat with them and sends you a notification every two weeks when they ~announce~ drop their new project.

It’s good to see that even in a global pandemic, the crew over there will continue to bring us absurdly joyful things like [All the Streams](https://allthestreams.fm), [Puff the Squeaky Chicken](https://buypuff.co/), and [MSCHF Box](https://mschfbox.com/).
