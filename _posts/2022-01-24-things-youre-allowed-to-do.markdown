I love this list from [Milan Cvitkovic](https://twitter.com/MWCvitkovic) reminding us of the things we’re allowed to do but that we often forget are options. Some favorites that I’ve actually done include: hire a tutor or coach, buy goods/services from your friends, get couples therapy, cold contact people, and fly to people for in-person meetings.
