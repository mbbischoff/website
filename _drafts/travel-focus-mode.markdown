Last summer, I visited Toronto to see my wife after being separated by pandemic-related border closures for months. I decided to use that trip as an excuse to test out the new iOS 15 Focus Mode feature.

Here’s how it works. I set up a [special focus mode](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1429069655629500416) called **Travel** that I manually switch into, or that automatically activates when I launch a flight tracking app or visit an airport in New York. When I’m in this mode, a few things happen all at once: my home screen switches to a (normally hidden) page that displays widgets for apps I always find myself searching for when I’m on a journey, my watch face changes via a Shortcuts automation to a special travel watch face, and my notifications are silenced except forthe people and apps that I’m expecting to interact with while traveling.

I found that this tiny automation made the somewhat stressful process of international air travel just a little bit smoother, and I’m looking forward to using it again when I fly to see her again soon 🤞. So, in the interest of sharing, here are my settings in case you want to use them to build your own travel focus mode.

## The Travel Focus Mode

*[Set this up in Settings → Focus](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608).*


* **Allowed Notifications**: Messages from friends, family, Find My, Kindle, Flighty, App in The Air, Uber. I also allow any time-sensitive notifications.
* **Focus Status**: Off. I don’t need to telegraph to the whole world that I’m traveling, because I’ll still check hidden notifications, just less frequently.
* **Home Screen**: Enable the custom tavel page and disable all other pages.
* **Name & Appearance**: I use a purple map pin icon, because I wasn’t using purple for anything else, and there’s no airplane icon available. 📍

## The Travel Home Screen

*[Create and hide this home screen](https://support.apple.com/en-me/HT211345) by tapping on the page dots on your home screen while in editing mode.*

From top to button, I include widgets that display:

* **[Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com)**: My gate, check-in, departure, and arrival time
* **Find My**: The location of my suitcase (via an AirTag), so I know when it’s getting close to me on the arrival side if I’ve checked it
* **Notes**: A permanant note called “Travel Documents” that always contains my boarding pass screenshot, COVID test, and anything else I may need to board.
* **Weather**: The current conditions in my destination city
* **Clock**: The current time at my destination, espcailly useful if changing time zones
* **Batteries**: Reminds me when I need to charge my devices, or where I need to conserve power while waiting through long delays
