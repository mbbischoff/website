  was a teenager. They chronicle interesting people’s hardware and software setups
  and end up being a fascinating window into the subject’s priorities and tastes when
  it comes to tools and toys. My own interview just went up on the site, so now you
  can read all the nerdy details of my setup.

I’ve been reading [Daniel Bogan’s](https://waferbaby.com) [Uses This](https://usesthis.com) (née The Setup) interview series since I was a teenager. They chronicle interesting people’s hardware and software setups and end up being a fascinating window into the subject’s priorities and tastes when it comes to tools and toys. 

[My own interview](https://usesthis.com/interviews/matthew.bischoff/) just went up on the site, so now you can read all the nerdy details of my setup. Let me know what you think!
