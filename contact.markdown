I’m an extrovert who loves hearing from old friends and making new ones. I really enjoy having conversations with people new to the technology industry, LGBTQ+ folks, and anyone that wants to work together or collaborate on creative projects. While I try to get back to everyone who reaches out, it may take me a bit if things are particularly hectic.
