A great video from *Vanity Fair* with [Nicholas Britell](https://www.nicholasbritell.com) who wrote the music for HBO’s [Succession](https://www.hbo.com/succession). This type of piece where you can watch a creator actually break down the _why_ behind their art is one of the most inspiring types of media for me. Seeing brilliant people work to elucidate their creations never gets old.
