description: I turned 30 years old today so I spent some time this afternoon reflecting
  and collecting 30 lessons I’ve learned in my time on earth so far. Merlin and Roderick
  sometimes call these types of lessons "thought technologies" and that certainly
  feels fitting considering how useful and applicable they’ve been for me. Each one
  of them has helped me during critical moments in my life so far. I hope you find
  even just one of them helpful in yours. See you tonight. ❤️

I turned 30 years old [today](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1344146214296678400) so I spent some time this afternoon reflecting and collecting 30 lessons I’ve learned in my time on earth so far and (as best as I could remember) where I learned them from. 

[Merlin and Roderick](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/) sometimes call these types of lessons “thought technologies” and that certainly feels fitting considering how useful and applicable they’ve been for me. Each one of them has helped me during critical moments in my life so far. I hope you find even just one of them helpful in yours. [See you tonight](https://matthewbischoff.com/30th-birthday/).
