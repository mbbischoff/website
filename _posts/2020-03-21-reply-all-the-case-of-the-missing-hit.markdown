description: After seeing this recent episode of Reply All recommended everywhere,
  I gave it a listen, and it’s as good as everyone says it is. Queue it up if you’re
  interested in music, mysteries, obsessiveness, journalism, or the intersections
  thereof. Also, if you want more like this, go back and listen to [Mystery Show](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/mystery-show).
  RIP.
