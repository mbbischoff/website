As I mentioned [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1243632324329254914) yesterday, I’m bringing back a project I did in 2016 called App Critique 🧐. The goal is to show how I evaluate the design of software with short video design reviews.

If you’d like your app design scrutinized, [fill out this form](https://matthewbischoff.typeform.com/to/RjX8si). Preference will be given to indie devs and small companies.
