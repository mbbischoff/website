I’m super excited that I’ll be speaking this May at the [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch/) conference in Lugano, Switzerland. App Builders is one of the biggest European conferences about mobile technologies, and I’ll be presenting alongside a bunch of incredibly smart folks. It’s sure to be a great time, and I hope to see you there! 🇨🇭
