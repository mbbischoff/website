I’ve been a fan of [beestung magazine](https://beestungmag.com), a quarterly publication publishing poetry by nonbinary writers since I discovered it a few years ago. This week, they published Issue 12 on the theme of trans futures, guest edited by [Cavar](https://www.cavar.club/). 

I’m honored that [two of my poems](https://beestungmag.com/issue12/in-your-ideal-world-what-does-the-future-of-gender-look-like-and-t4t-by-matthew-bischoff/) are included in the issue alongside fantastically inventive work by other nonbinary poets. It would a lot to me if you gave it a look as it’s the first time any of my poems have been published.
