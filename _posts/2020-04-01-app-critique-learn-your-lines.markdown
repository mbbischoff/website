As I [mentioned the other day](https://matthewbischoff.com/app-critique/), I’m bringing back my App Critique video series, and the first submission is the app *[Learn Your Lines!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-your-lines/id1433138502)* from [Andrew Cote](https://twitter.com/andrewthecope). In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UN1TR5SfvY) I walk through the app as a brand new user and point out some potential areas for improvement in the app’s UX and UI.
