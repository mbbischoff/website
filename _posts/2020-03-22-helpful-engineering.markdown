> Helpful Engineering is designing, sourcing and executing projects to help people suffering from the COVID-19 crisis worldwide.
> 
> We are an open community of volunteers without a commercial purpose. We believe that through a utilitarian approach, we can do the most good in the quickest time. Applying unused engineering and manufacturing resources, we can help the world cope with the threat of COVID-19.

I’m super impressed by the speed and organization of this group of volunteer engineers that are working on a number of [really useful projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cM87eJdXhP_8e9gJJZ_SnZXdo_huWsBmMzcqYWbhEOg/edit#heading=h.ri325rphx0lu) in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. If you’ve got spare time, resources, or engineering know-how, consider [joining their efforts](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScu-4OOB5dGLWoSIA33CkAH__LE6b_M2PKRh0z6PMavL39uUQ/viewform).
