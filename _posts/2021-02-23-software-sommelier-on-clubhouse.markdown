  A few years ago, I let folks on Twitter ask for software recommendationsfor any problem they need solved with an app. People loved it and I loved helping people find the perfect software solutions to their quandaries.

  This Friday at 3 PM ET, I’m experimenting with a version of the same thing on Clubhouse. Co-hosted by my friend and colleague, Jillian Meehan. It’ll be be a fun, nerdy time and we’d love to hear you there.
